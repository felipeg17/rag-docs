What is ROS?\nFor someone completely new to ROS, the best way to think about it is a collection of tools and frameworks\nwhich make automating robotics projects much easier. Every ROS project has a certain structure which you\nhave to follow. Your job would be to fill in the automation code along defining how the different parts of your\ncode are communicating with one another. Once this is done, the underlying ROS framework takes care of the\nactual networking and connections.\nROS also has the advantage of having a large open source community with tons of packages. This means you\nhave a lot of prewritten code to help with your project and you don’t have to start from scratch.",

In simple terms nodes are programs that perform a particular task and send out/receive data\nin the form of messages. These messages are exchanged between two nodes over the topic (edge) connecting\nthem. An example of a typical ROS system is given in the figure to the left wherein “robot”, “laser”, “map”,\n“localisation” and “planner” are the nodes and the arrows connecting the nodes are the topics.
