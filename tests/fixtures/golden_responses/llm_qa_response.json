    "content": "ROS, or Robot Operating System, is a collection of tools and frameworks designed to simplify the automation of robotics projects. It provides a structured environment where developers can fill in automation code and define how different parts of their code communicate with one another. The underlying ROS framework manages the networking and connections between these components.\n\nROS is used for developing robotics applications by allowing users to leverage a large open-source community and a wealth of prewritten code, which helps in accelerating project development without starting from scratch. It organizes all the software and code in the form of packages, which may include ROS nodes, libraries, message and service definitions, and dependencies. Essentially, ROS facilitates the creation and management of complex robotic systems by enabling communication between various programs (nodes) through data exchange over topics.",

What is ROS?\nFor someone completely new to ROS, the best way to think about it is a collection of tools and frameworks\nwhich make automating robotics projects much easier. Every ROS project has a certain structure which you\nhave to follow. Your job would be to fill in the automation code along defining how the different parts of your\ncode are communicating with one another. Once this is done, the underlying ROS framework takes care of the\nactual networking and connections.\nROS also has the advantage of having a large open source community with tons of packages. This means you\nhave a lot of prewritten code to help with your project and you don’t have to start from scratch.",

In simple terms nodes are programs that perform a particular task and send out/receive data\nin the form of messages. These messages are exchanged between two nodes over the topic (edge) connecting\nthem. An example of a typical ROS system is given in the figure to the left wherein “robot”, “laser”, “map”,\n“localisation” and “planner” are the nodes and the arrows connecting the nodes are the topics.
